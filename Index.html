    </center>

    <h3>My trip to California</h3>
    <p>It was an early June morning and I was packing for a trip that we were leaving for in five hours. I was very
        excited because I was going to California for the first time. The reason I was going to California was because I
        really wanted to go there, and my sister wanted me to visit her. My mom’s birthday was also during this week,
        and she wanted to see my sister so we decided to go visit her. This paper is going to be over my trip to Los
        Angeles, California over the summer.</p>

    <h3>My Tip To The Rockies</h3>
    <p>While in Los Angeles I hiked to the top of the Hollywood sign, went to a Logic concert, and took a tour of the
        Warner Brothers Studio. After a long flight we had finally got to California. When we initially got there my
        sister was waiting for …show more content…
        After we ate we started going around to sites where we could take pictures of the city. The big site we were
        going to was the top of the Mount Lee which is where the Hollywood sign is located. I was very nervous because
        it was hot outside, but excited that we were going to climb all the way to the top.</p>

    <h3>My Trip To THe Mid West</h3>
    <p>Before going to the sign though my sister said she had a surprise for us and that we were going to love this next
        place. After walking for awhile we finally made it to a big cave. I did not recognize it at first but once my
        sister had told me it was the Adam West batcave I was very eager to take my picture inside. Once we were done
        taking pictures and walking around we started our hike up to the sign.</p>

    <h4>I am a lecturer in the Stanford Computer Science Department. Before coming to Stanford, I spent two years as a
        programmer at Taligent (now part of IBM). At Taligent, I worked on Places for Project Teams, a groupware product
        designed to improve communication and coordination within small project teams. I was fortunate to work with the
        Places for
        Project Teams product throughout an entire software lifecycle—from initial product conception through the actual
        product
        launch.

    <h4>I have a Ph D. from the University of California, Irvine, where I specialized in Software Engineering. My
        dissertation was on
        process support for software engineering teams. I also have a masters degree from Irvine, with a specialization
        in Artificial
        Intelligence, and bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.

                Professor Richard Zare in his lab. Whether it's the summer
                grass that tickles your feet or the bed Bordeaux smacking on
                your palate, nearly every part of the world around you carries
                special chemical markers. These markers, called isotopes, can
                tell scientists where the molecules that compose a substance
                are from where they travelled and what happened to them
                along the way. But doing these analyses has been complex
                and costly. Now, Stanford chemists have developed a new
                method to make isotopic analysis easier and less expensive.

                is an epicenter for the vintage dance movement --- but life in the Stanford
                dance world is not all foxtrots and tangos. The June 26-28 Stanford's
                Dance Weekend in Roble Gym offers something for modern dance enthusiasts, too:
                the hustle, the West Coast swing, 1970s disco hustle, Bollywood and blues fashion.
